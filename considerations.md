# Considerations

## ReadWriteDirectory
The project reads a defined directory to read/write operations.
Every time an LMMS XPT File is genereated, it will be under here.

## Sargams - read array
When the application starts, it reads the sargam notations from sargams.txt file.
Each line mentions a project's full sargam note.
A # character can be used as a comment, when used in the front of the line.
